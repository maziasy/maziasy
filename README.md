## Hi there, I'm Mazia 👋

I'm a **Full-Stack Software Developer** based in Toronto 🇨🇦 with expertise in **early-stage startup environments**.  
I enjoy building developer-centric tools, optimizing systems for performance and cost, and diving deep into **databases, backend architecture, and API integrations**.

- 🌱 Currently learning: database internals by building a SQL database from scratch  
- 💡 Recent projects: [SQL Database (WIP)](https://github.com/maziasy/my-sql-database)
- 🎯 Goal: contribute to early-stage startups and open-source projects  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I care deeply about animal rescue, and have helped find forever homes for over 200 cats through my local rescue.
